# Doxy-saurus
A custom Doxygen parser that exports comment blocks into markdown files tailored specifically for Docusaurus documentation pages.

This repository is specifically made for [`ml-in-c`](https://github.com/PeppermintSnow/ml-in-c).

Further use for other repositories is possible, but not planned. Currently, it does not support custom ouput formats, but feel free to create a fork and extend the parser to suit your needs.

## Usage
``` bash
python -m doxy-saurus <input_folder> <output_folder>
```
